Always eager to assist and never without a positive attitude, he made work fun and is the embodiment of a team player. Eddie is a breath of fresh air in a world where developers and other teams often struggle to communicate. As a QA analyst, I rarely saw Eddie without a solution. He was always ready to assist with any bugs that I found, and more than willing to take time to explain not only the solution and impact, but also offer suggestions for how we, as a team, could improve in the future. Eddie is approachable and strives to create an environment where open communication with developers about issues large or small is the norm. Eddie helped set high expectations for team communication and continually provided updates of his progress, complications, time estimates, impacts, and successes throughout the day. Working with Eddie has truly been a pleasure and I hope for the chance to work together again."

I found him knowledgeable as a technology consultant, VERY effective as a Frontend Developer, and peerless when interfacing with clients. Eddie is also a great problem solver and is constantly exploring innovative/fringe techniques to better service his company and their clients. However, Eddie's greatest asset is his character. He would often work tirelessly to meet a deadline or delight a client and could do so joyfully and effectively. His humble nature will be the first thing you notice after meeting him and will strike you more after you get to see his work. Lastly, Eddie's positive attitude can uplift both internal team members and the clients he serves, even in the direst of circumstances. I am truly sad to see him leave and eagerly hope to work with him again!"

He was able to work autonomously as a remote employee while still connecting with our team on a personal level, which is difficult to do. As a developer, he went from caught up to speed very quickly and always looked for new challenges. We are very proud of the growth we saw and are excited for him to step out into a new world and share his talent with others. We will miss you sir. It was a pleasure working with you."
