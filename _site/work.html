Part of this doubling in size was, in part, due to creating a Design team, which never existed at ThreatConnect previously.<br><br>I co-led a cross-department effort between engineering and product management to revitalize our product development process to be more effective and efficient, including an effort to reconfigure our use of Jira from three disjointed projects into one.<br><br>I planned and led virtual offsite meetings across engineering, product management as well as the user experience team.

Eddie is a breath of fresh air in a world where developers and other teams often struggle to communicate. As a QA analyst, I rarely saw Eddie without a solution. He was always ready to assist with any bugs that I found, and more than willing to take time to explain not only the solution and impact, but also offer suggestions for how we, as a team, could improve in the future. Eddie is approachable and strives to create an environment where open communication with developers about issues large or small is the norm. Eddie helped set high expectations for team communication and continually provided updates of his progress, complications, time estimates, impacts, and successes throughout the day. Working with Eddie has truly been a pleasure and I hope for the chance to work together again.</div>
